# Tonemap and Bloom
Tonemap and Bloom is an algorithm created for the research project of the Computer Science and Engineering bachelor of Delft University of Technology. 

The technique extends on existing tone mapping algorithms by making the brightest areas emit a glow. To do this, the bloom shader effect is used. We take the image with the lowest exposure value, and perform convolution on it with a given kernel. For a realistic effect, this kernel should be similar to a cameraâ€™s response to a single point of light. 

There are also several parameters. The smoothing factor changes how bright a pixel needs to be to emit a significant glow. The bloom intensity changes the intensity of the glow when it's merged with the tone mapped image. Finally, the kernel size determines the spread of the glow. 

A full overview of the technique can be seen below:

## Code Structure
The code consists of four parts. `tonemap_and_bloom.py` is the general algorithm, along with some helpful tools such as image saving and loading. `main.py` runs the algorithm and saves it in the img folder. `application.py` is a Kivy user interface to run the algorithm more easily. The last image created is stored in img/app_output. Finally, `time.py` output the average runtime for an image.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- OpenCV2
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Kivy (for running the application only)
